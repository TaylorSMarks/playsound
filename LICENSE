Files used for Unit Tests were downloaded from Wikimedia Commons - they and their licenses can be found at the following urls.
I am not a lawyer, but it's my belief that as these files are merely used for unit testing and in no way necessary for using
playsound that playsound can be distributed under the more permissive (supperior, actual free) MIT license and that the
cancerous copyleft bullshit from the Creative Commons licenses that most of the files have:
